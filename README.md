# Dia Engine

This is a simple Game Engine to learn C++, OpenGL and GameDevelopment

## Setup macOS

For now, the Makefile is made to work in macOS; with a little changes (library paths) it can be easy ported to linux.

For macOS you need to install glfw3, the easies way is throught [brew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install glfw
```

Clone the repo

```
git@github.com:Gidrek/DiaEngine.git
```

Create a **build** directory. Then run the make command.

```
make
```

## Run the game

```
make run
```
